## About

C8 is a terminal user interface tooklit made to run and debug **CHIP-8**, **S-CHIP**, and **XO-CHIP** games. At its core you can 
* run a rom with `c8 run [ROM_PATH]`
    * add `--debug` to enable debug mode
    * add `--kind` followed by `vip`, `chip8`, `schip`, or `xochip` to force other CHIP-8 variants if auto-select fails
    * add `--hz` followed by your target instructions per second if needed
* disassemble a rom into a file with `c8 dasm [ROM_PATH] > [OUTPUT_FILE_PATH]`
* check a rom for potential issues* with `c8 check [ROM_PATH]`

## Installation

C8 is tested mostly on Windows but should work on Mac and Linux. If on Linux, see [below](#caveats) for required system packages before you continue.

At this moment C8 can only be installed from source with [cargo](https://crates.io/). Rust 1.65.0 or greater is required.

```
git clone https://github.com/tochiu/c8.git
cd c8
cargo install --path ./
```
To be sure C8 is installed, run the classic IBM Logo ROM from the repository directory
```
c8 run roms/c8/ibm_logo.ch8
```

### Caveats

On Linux, the X11 development libraries are required to query keyboard state from the OS since terminals generally do not support key up events. In addition, the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) development libraries are required on the system.

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt install libx11-dev
sudo apt install librust-alsa-sys-dev
```

On Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:
```
sudo dnf install xorg-x11-server-devel
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel
```

On newer versions of MacOS, you may run into issues where you only see meta keys such as shift,
backspace, et cetera. This is due to a permission issue. To work around this:

* open the MacOS system preferences
* go to Security -> Privacy
* scroll down to Accessibility and unlock it
* add your terminal to the list

## Motivation
This is my first _completed_ rust project (haha). A friend of mine sent me an [article](https://tobiasvl.github.io/blog/write-a-chip-8-emulator/) on how to get started with writing emulators with CHIP-8. It was a super interesting read and a good excuse to learn Rust! After I finished the emulator, I thought I could go further. So here we are. If you're thinking about writing your own CHIP-8 emulator, you should! It's a great start to emulation development and building on top of it with other CHIP-8 variants is an excellent exercise in writing extensible software.
